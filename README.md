# Stripe Demo Merchant Store

This repository provides a minimal single-product merchant experience that uses Stripe Checkout and a Spring Boot backend. It is
intended for testing EnsureBack integrations with a realistic checkout and order logging flow.

## Project structure

```
/backend   # Spring Boot API and Stripe webhooks
/frontend  # React + Tailwind storefront
```

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Stripe CLI (for local webhook testing)

## Environment configuration

Copy the example environment file and fill in your Stripe test credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the following values:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: your Stripe test secret key (`sk_test_*`)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: generated by the Stripe CLI when forwarding webhooks
- Optionally, `FRONTEND_URL`: base URL for the React app (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`)

The Spring Boot application reads these variables automatically.

## Running the backend

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:8080` and exposes:

- `POST /api/checkout/create-session` → create a Stripe Checkout session for the headphones product
- `POST /webhook` → Stripe webhook handler for completed and failed payments
- `GET /api/orders` → retrieve logged orders from the H2 database

## Running the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The storefront is available at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API calls to the backend during development.

## Stripe webhook forwarding

Run the Stripe CLI in a separate terminal to forward events to your local backend:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/webhook
```

Use the Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any future expiry date and CVC `123` to simulate successful
payments.

## Building for production

To produce optimized assets for the storefront:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

To package the backend:

```bash
cd backend
mvn package
```

## Order lifecycle

1. The React storefront calls `POST /api/checkout/create-session` when the shopper clicks **Buy Now**.
2. Stripe Checkout collects payment details and redirects back to `/success` or `/cancel`.
3. Webhooks from Stripe mark orders as `PAID` or `FAILED` in the H2 database.
4. The success page polls `GET /api/orders` to display the final order status to the shopper.
